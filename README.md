DB Monitor is an open source MySQL / MariaDB monitoring tool for OS X.  Its primary use is debugging cluster performance across many nodes of MySQL.  It understands database replication, and supports multiple configuration files and multiple windows so you can organize your environment monitoring the way that you find most convenient!

It is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

It also uses a modified version of Karl Kraft's fantastic mysql_connector library.  you can find that project here: http://www.karlkraft.com/index.php/2010/06/02/mysql-and-objective-c/
If you wish to redistribute his library in addition to my work, please contact him directly, my license does not apply to his code though it is included in this repository.

Please feel free to download and contribute to my project!

Let me know if you have any questions!

You can also download it for free in the Mac App Store : https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/db-monitor/id673635398?mt=12
